- **Summary:** Positron Emission Tomography (PET) image reconstruction is inherently challenged by
Poisson noise and physical degradation factors, which are further exacerbated in
limited-angle acquisitions. While deep learning methods demonstrate promising
performance, their generalization to unseen clinical data distributions remains limited
without extensive retraining. We propose PET-Adapter, a test-time domain adaptation
framework for generative PET reconstruction models pretrained solely on phantom data.
Our method enables adaptation to clinical datasets with varying anatomies, tracers, and
scanner configurations without requiring paired ground truth. PET-Adapter introduces
layer-wise low-rank anatomical conditioning during adaptation and Ordered Subset
Expectation Maximization-based warm-starting that initializes the generation from
physics-informed reconstructions, reducing diffusion steps from 50 to 2 without
compromising quality. Experiments across multiple clinical datasets demonstrate superior
3D reconstruction performance in both full-angle and limited-angle settings,
highlighting the clinical feasibility and computational efficiency of the proposed
approach.

### 2026-05-11 - LearnMate^2: Design and Evaluation of an LLM-powered Personalized and Adaptive Support System for Online Learning

- **arXiv:** [2605.06257v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2605.06257v1)

- **Summary:** Personalization is crucial for effective learning, yet online learning, designed for
widespread availability and open access, lacks personalized guidance. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to bridge this gap. We
explore how LLM-driven tools may be designed to support personalized and adaptive
learning and examine how they shape user experience and learning outcomes. We
iteratively designed \tool{} to support online learning by providing personalized study
plans, real-time contextual assistance, and adaptive learning activities. A preliminary
study ($n=24$) assessed the effectiveness and usability of \tool{} and informed
refinements in our system, which we then evaluated ($n = 16$) against a combination of a
state-of-the-art online learning platform and an LLM for learning support. Results
indicate that \tool{} advances AI pedagogy by improving both learning outcomes and user
experience compared to existing online learning and support tools. This work advances
our understanding of the design space of personalized, AI-driven educational tools and
their potential impact on user experience.
